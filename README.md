An iOS MyAnimeList client

This is a project that I used to learn Swift and iOS app development. Used the MyAnimeList and Jikan API (and AniList API for retrieving the next episode airing schedule for animes).

<img src="images/list.png?" width="180" height="390"/> <img src="images/anime.png?" width="180" height="390"/> <img src="images/edit.png?" width="180" height="390"/>

## Features

* View current top animes/mangas
* View animes airing in a specified season
* Search for a particular anime/manga
* View, edit, add and remove animes/mangas on user's list by logging in to MyAnimeList account
* Customise how the app looks
* Look at the information, next episode airing schedule, trailers, characters, staffs, authors, related items, recommendations, opening and ending themes and reviews of anime and manga

## Things to be done
